### This is a Fahdon exclusive expansion to Styyx's Starint ing Classes - A lightweight class system that gives you starting gear and some class based abilities.

The following are the class addons. In addition to these classes, each original (spellcasting) class has received a toolset upgrade. Instead of spelltomes, you will now receive the actual spells.

# Esoteric Sorcerer
Besting the most well-equipped fighters, Sorcerers rely on the spells of the mystic arts. Unique to these mages is the bodily stamina to be armed with the thickest armor. Sorcerers also possess the unique ability to absorb magicka from spells targeted at them, serving in essence as magical "batteries," and possess more magicka than any other mage class.

Sorcerers are adept at the use of a wide variety of weapons and armor, but typically do not utilize shields, preferring to keep their hands free for defensive spellcasting instead, their specialty.

## Abilities

**Spell Devourer** - Functioning as a magical "battery", you absorb magicka from spells which target you. *(Magicka Restored on spell hit == all your spell absorption effects' magnitudes * the calculated magicka cost of the spell / 100)*

**Arcane Knight** - As a master of manipulating magicka, the Sorcerer gains a powerful advantage in battle. They can enhance their physical abilities and learn Heavy Armor skills 10% faster, while also gaining a bonus of +50 to magicka. However, this intense devotion to the arcane has taken a toll on the Sorcerer's physical well-being, leading to a -25 health penalty.

# Zealous Witch Hunter
Witch Hunters are skilled in the art of detecting and eradicating supernatural threats to the land, such as undead, daedra, and cursed creatures. They have a mastery of archery, alchemy, and illusion magic, making them versatile and formidable adversaries.

## Abilities

**Cursed Prey** - As a Witch Hunter, you have honed your ability to detect and destroy the unnatural creatures that threaten the land. With **Arcane Purge**, you deal 10% increased damage to undead, daedra, and magical and cursed creatures.
