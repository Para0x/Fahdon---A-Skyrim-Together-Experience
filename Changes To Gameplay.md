# Changes to Gameplay
This will serve as a comprehensive guide to familiarize yourself with the changes made in Fahdon.

# Gameplay
At its core, Fahdon uses Adamant for its perk overhaul. It's simplistic by design and pairs wonderfully with the functionality of STR.

Other notable gameplay changing mods are:

1. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) - You gain levels by completing quests, defeating encounters and exploring. Skills no longer contribute to your character's level. This has been further tweaked by the inclusion of the DND-XP preset, which drastically overhauls the rate at which you gain XP from a variety of sources.

2. [Sets of Skills](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55535?tab=posts) - A nonintrusive class mod that adds class-based progression and prestiging to further provide the player means of truly embodying their class and setting themselves apart from their party members. I encourage you to read up on its mod page for all the information.

3. [Starting in Classes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72410) - In addition to Sets of Skills bonuses, this mod provides a scroll at the start of the game called "Choose Your Destiny". This will allow you to immediately obtain an equipment loadout and a nice buff/malus that reflects your class choice.

4. [Phylogeny - Races of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44371) - Overhauls the racial bonuses by eschewing the daily powers in favor of passive abilities.

5. [Know Your Enemy Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55045) & [Know Your Enemy Redux Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55203) - Distributes resistances & weaknesses to creatures, weapons & armors. There isn't one right tool for every situation.

6. [Curse of the Vampire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10086) - A well-crafted vampire overhaul that leans into the roleplay aspects of vampire lore in elder scrolls. You will have to conceal yourself from the sun and will feel unwelcome in areas that are influenced by the Eight.

7. [Curse of the Firmament](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28419) - Due to how STR shares the buffs of standing stones with all players in the party, opting to have a standing stone mod that has all its abilities unlockable in an MCM, allows for every player to have their own bonuses that actually benefit their class. 

However, in addition to this standing stone overhaul, you may notice that the familiar standing stone locations appear in disarray and inert. Some exploration will be required to locate the new standing stones and claim your birthsign's power.

6. [Auto-Lockpicking](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59027) - Playing into the D&D Adventurer's party theme, this mod completely changes the manual lockpick system to that of a more traditional Difficulty Check. For example, a door might have a DC 12 lockpick check. You gain bonuses to your roll based on your Security level, so thieves can really feel useful in this party-based adventure.

7. [Solvable Dragon Claw Doors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75793/) - Dragon Claw doors are no longer simply solved by turning the claw over and putting the combination in you see on the back of the claw. Now, you will need to actually look at the walls in the hall of stories to correctly solve each door and gain access to the final room!

# Combat
Fahdon uses the fantastic [Valvalis Combat - Visceral Tactics](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73836?tab=description) as its combat mod of choice. This is a mash-up of both Valhalla Combat and Valravn. Rounding this off with Chocolate Poise, do not expect to be able to blindly spam attack your way through every encounter. In most cases, you will have to make a plan of attack for every dungeon and bandit hideout you enter.

Notable Mods:
1. [Archery Locational Damage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63863) - Introduces a locational damage system for projectiles. Be aware that NPCs also have access to this ability, so keep your shields up and helmets on.

2. [Elden Parry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70240) - The standard block bash has been replaced with a more fluid system. When bashing with a shield as an enemy strikes, it will cause a parry and briefly stagger them, leaving them open to an attack of opportunity.

3. [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) - Drastically increases the difficulty of dragon fights. No longer are these majestic creatures easily felled. They will be a force to reckon with, so come prepared.

4. [Rogues 'N Raiders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47504) - Introduces classes to the bandit faction, which means bandits now have specific roles and will try to leverage their advantages and work as a team to take you down.

5. [Fanatical Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68536) - New enemies and enemy variants have been added to a number of the occult factions of Skyrim.

6. [Haugbui](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26188) - An overhaul of the draugr all over Skyrim, changing up their progression and offering more variants as well.

7. [Silver is For Monsters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70863) - In the base game, the damage bonus of silver crossbows in the game is rather . . unappealing, so this mod modifies it by implementing a multiplicative bonus to the weapon damage instead, making it more dynamic and scalable. The range of creatures susceptible to silver weapons has also been expanded, and now includes more magical or cursed creatures, creating an incentive for players to keep a silver weapon on hand.

# Magic Overhaul
At the base of our magic overhaul is [Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](). On its own, it provides a fantastic collection of spells fit for any spellcaster. However, this isn't the only spell arsenal available to you:

1. [Arcanum - A New Age of Magic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488) - Designed to be a journey of magical experimentation, different schools of magic and different styles within those schools, have been given unique identities and gameplay mechanics. These lend themselves to creative synergies and combos.

2. [Hemomancy - Blood Magic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74968) - Ever wanted to be a Blood Mage? Sacrificing your very lifeforce to siphon that of your enemies? Tired of Magicka pools depleting and slowing down your quest for power? Then this magic is for you.

3. [Natura](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77826) - A nature-based spell mod that breathes new life into poison spells and both restoration and alteration as a druid.

4. [Depths of the Reach (a.k.a Darkstorm)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77718) - The powers of the void are at your fingertips. Gain the right amount of power, and your quest to unlocking these magics will begin.

5. [Kthonia Minions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76082) - A series of summons from the ashy lands of Morrowind.

# Quests & New Lands

2. [Actually Challenging Radiant Quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75651) - No longer will you be able to follow a map marker certain radiant bounty or retrieval quests. Instead, you will be given a clue of the general Hold and will need to gather information yourself by asking the locals.

3. [Darkend](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423) - The final resting place of a ship wrecked long ago, The Voyager's End, they call it. Rumor has it that something has been stirring there recently and has the locals concerned. Travel Northwest of Winterhold to discover the truth for yourself.

4. [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917) - Travel to the County of Bruma, where the seat of Empire has its strongest influences. A number of new dungeons, quests and adventures await you.

5. [Wares of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31519) - There is word of a merchant vessel moored in Dawnstar, by the name of the Dawn's Venture. Rumor has it that they are selling wares from all across the provinces. Might be worth checking it out.

6. [Heart of the Reach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76494) - A quest that will send you into the Ever-Bog. Word has spread of a priest in Markarth that is looking for help within this underground swamp. Whether or not you answer his plea, the choice is yours.

7. [Observatory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72405) - You have heard mention that necromancer activity has started growing near the entrance to the Jerall Mountains. It's been said that suspicious individuals are seen entering and leaving the mouth of a cave near the Glenmoril Coven.
